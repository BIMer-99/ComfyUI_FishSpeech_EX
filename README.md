# ComfyUI_Hunyuan3D_EX

This plugin is optimized for Fish-Speech-1.5 version and is only applicable to version 1.5:
1. The plugin references the ComfyUI-fish-speech plugin for optimization, and modifies the overall configuration address and installation method.
2. The required Python libraries for the plugin have been improved, mainly vector-quantize-pytorch. If this library is not installed, the audio quality will be poor. `This problem has been bothering me for a few days, and I searched the entire FishSpeech plugin to find the sampling step issue. If this problem has also been bothering you, please give it a like, thank you!`
